### MyUW, My UW-Madison, My UW-System
Bare 'MyUW' never has a space between the letters. However, 'My UW-Madison' and 'My UW-System' are always spaced and dashed as so.
### App Title
30 characters maximum. Avoid the word “your.” When possible, avoid the word “my” unless it’s necessary to differentiate it from another app. (For example, an app with a list of a student’s courses would be titled “My Courses” because a “Courses” app would be a list of all courses at the university.)
### App Description
80 characters maximum. Avoid the word “your.” (For example, instead of “view your earnings and tax statements,” use “view earnings and tax statements.”)
